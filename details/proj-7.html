        <h1>Deployed static website to the cloud</h1>
        <p>This project is about hosting a static website. In this project I deployed a static to AWS by performing the following steps.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Created a public S3 bucket and uploaded website files to my bucket.</li>
            <li>Next I configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies.</li>
            <li>Then sped up content delivery using content distribution network service (CloudFront)</li>
            <li>Finally accessed my website in a browser.</li>
        </ul>
